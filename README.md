🚀 Task Scheduling System (Like CPU Scheduling)

The Task Scheduling System is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help users efficiently manage tasks using data structures like Min-Heap and Priority Queue. Inspired by CPU scheduling algorithms, it ensures that high-priority tasks are addressed first, streamlining task management and boosting productivity.

This system comes packed with essential features, including the ability to add, edit, and delete tasks, making it easy to create new tasks, update existing ones, or remove completed ones. With priority-based task management, users can assign tasks as High, Medium, or Low priority, ensuring critical tasks are handled first. A status tracking feature lets users mark tasks as Pending or Completed, while the search and filtering options make finding specific tasks quick and simple. The interface is built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript, offering a clean and intuitive user experience.

The core tech stack includes HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript for the frontend. Backend integration is optional and can be implemented using frameworks like Node.js, Django, or Flask. For data persistence, databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, or Firebase can be integrated.

💡 How It Works

Users can add a task by entering its details, setting a priority, and optionally adding a due date. All tasks are displayed in a sorted list based on priority, with options to edit or delete them as needed. Task progress can be tracked by marking them as Pending or Completed. The built-in search and filtering features help users quickly locate tasks, while high-priority tasks are always displayed at the top to ensure they get the necessary attention.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Planned features include drag-and-drop task reordering, deadline reminders and notifications, user authentication & profiles, backend integration for data persistence, and an analytics dashboard to provide productivity insights.
