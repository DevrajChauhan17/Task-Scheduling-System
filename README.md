Task Scheduling System (Like CPU Scheduling)
The Task Scheduling System is designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks using Min-Heap and Priority Queue concepts. It ensures that high-priority tasks are addressed first, making task management more organized and effective. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks, set priorities as High, Medium, or Low, and track progress by marking tasks as Pending or Completed. The system also includes a search and filter feature to quickly find specific tasks, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.

Built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript, this project provides a clean and simple interface. If integrated with a backend, technologies like Node.js, Django, or Flask can be used, along with a database like MySQL, MongoDB, or Firebase for data storage.

The workflow is straightforward—users can add tasks with priority levels, manage them through an organized list, update statuses, and filter tasks based on priority. Future improvements may include auto-prioritization based on deadlines, drag-and-drop task reordering, reminders, and backend integration for persistent data storage.
